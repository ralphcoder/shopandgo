## ---------ðŸ––Automatic billing SystemðŸ––---------

### Description

*An **automatic billing system** ðŸ›’ for providing an ease to the customers to bill their products by themself while shopping*

"Oh, the Codeforces contest has started and I am still waiting for my turn for billing"ðŸ˜© - it's n there any solution for thisðŸ¤”, and suddenly an idea stricks my mindðŸ’¡. Why not customers bill their products themselves. We all have faced this scenario in shopping complexes when we have some urgent work but have to wait in long lines for our turn. So we have made the "automatic billing system"ðŸ›’ which will:-


- Reduces the manual labor of the supermarket.
- Insure social distancing, and will prevent people from making the crowd during this pandemic.
- Increasing sales and providing positive feedback for companies.
- Will save lots of time by overriding the old inline billing system.
- Costomers with few items also has to stand in a queue which is really irritating.
- People who are in a hurry tend to spend less time buying things as they also have to add the time wasted during the billing process in their schedule.
- Seeing the current scenario maintenance of social distancing will be a concern for the future..

This app demonstrates how to build an end-to-end user experience between customer and Mall.

The goal of this app is to showcase an automatic billing machine. The following use cases are covered:
* Barcode detection - An end to end barcode scanning solution on the various products.

5.	All the details (product code, quantity, colour, price) of the product displays on the screen. (Based on the product code fetched from barcode, all the information from database will be taken and displayed over the scree). 
    Recommendations are displayed at bottom (Using ML and previous billing history the system will display the appropriate products which customer can prefer to buy).
